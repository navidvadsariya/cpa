From this workshop I learned how to code a program that gets input from the user and stores it in a 
variable. Then perform calculations and print the desired results.
This workshop was interesting because it has calculations wherein results needs to be casted properly in 
order to get the correct result. 
This workshop was a bit tough because it needs proper casting and multiple input values needs to be 
tested in order to test that the program works for different inputs and outputs the correct results.
Converting floating values to integers will help in eliminating erroneous results (I had incorrect results 
because of not casting a value to integer). 
Using the modules operator code is shorter whereas using division and subtraction method code will be 
long. Also modifying the code will be easier when using modules operator.
